    <div class="aboutText">
        <p>An engineer and an artist, I'm obsessed with circular, equitable economies and the technologies and creativity that they necessitate.</p>
        <p>I currently work for an architecture firm modeling buildings, creating widgets and graphics, and researching decarbonization of the building sector and how to integrate operational energy and embodied carbon modeling into existing project workflows. I also have worked for the Princeton Behavioral Science for Policy Lab analyzing sentiment towards renewables in different areas of the energy sector and for the Center for Climate and Security writing about climate impacts on national security in terms of resource scarcity and conflict escalation. I graduated from Princeton last year with a degree called Engineering and the Liberal Arts, a combination of civil engineering, chemistry, politics, and design, all centered around sustainable technologies and infrastructures.</p>
        <p>My artwork seeks to blend concepts from these different fields into a common dialogue and to highlight the beauty of both human ingenuity and the natural world.</p>
        <p>This site's code is evidence of my recent web dev phase. Right now it hosts some visual artwork and some written work. More sciencey and numbery things I've created are coming here soon :&rpar;</p>
