    <div class="aboutText">
        <p>An engineer and an artist, I'm obsessed with circular, equitable economies and the technologies that they necessitate. I strive to find connections between diciplines that create harmony amongst humans. The words and images on this site are part of this effort.</p>
        <p>I currently work for an architecture firm and think a lot about the decarbonization of the built environment. I also have worked for the Princeton Behavioral Science for Policy Lab analyzing the Indian energy sector's phase-out of coal and the Center for Climate and Security researching climate impacts on national security and human rights. I graduated from Princeton last year with a degree called Engineering and the Liberal Arts, a hodgepodge of things centered around climate technologies and sustainable development.</p>
        <p>This site's code is evidence of my recent web dev phase. Sciencey and numbery things I've created are coming here soon :&rpar;</p>
