                <p class="p1" style="font-size: 14px;">Sonification is the communication of data through sound. Different algorithms can be used to map numbers onto sounds, typically with higher numbers corresponding to a higher pitch.</p>
                <p class="p1" style="font-size: 14px;">In order to communicate numerical measurements and research, one must effectively and memorably convey dataset trends. Sonification is a very powerful way to do so. Altering the tonality of the sound, the number of notes included in the algorithm, and the frequency with which data is sampled changes the sonic experience of the listener. Some compositions could cause the data to be stored as a more potent memory than others, having a greater impact on listeners’ future actions.</p>
                <p class="p1" style="font-size: 14px;">This project, completed as my senior thesis at Princeton University, compared sonifications of minor and major tonality and sonifications mapped over one versus six octaves. It also explored sonifications of monthly versus yearly temperature data points.</p>
                <p class="p1" style="font-size: 14px;">Two datasets, in particular, were sonified. These were the 4.5 and 8.5 Representative Construction Pathways (RCPs) from The International Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC5) [6] for New York City, NY, downscaled by the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) [7].</p>
                <p class="p1" style="font-size: 14px;">The final sonifications for the project served to compare the two datasets. They consist of a backtrack of each RCP’s monthly temperature data sonified over one octave. The yearly data for each RCP sonified over six octaves is then overlaid as a sort of melody. These pieces are below, along with their graphical equivalents.</p>

                    <p class="p1" style="font-size: 14px;">It is difficult to compare between datasets of temperature predictions because changes in the atmosphere’s temperature are much more minute than the effects they induce. The maximum temperature between today and 2100 for RCP 8.5 is only 4º higher than that of RCP 4.5. This is one of the reasons why people find it so hard to internalize the effect that we are having on the natural world.</p>
                    <p class="p1" style="font-size: 14px;">Comparing a sonification of the 4.5 pathway with that of the 8.5 pathway, both sonified according to the same algorithm, hopefully sparks a different understanding of the differences between the two datasets, and the much more drastic rise of the latter. This more drastic rise should induce a greater feeling of anxiety in a listener. The knowledge that this anxiety corresponds to a possible future is powerful.</p>
                    <p class="p1" style="font-size: 14px;">Combining monthly with yearly data allows a listener to better internalize the complexity of the story the data is telling; the backtrack of the seasonal variation behind the gradual rise in temperature.</p>
                    <p class="p1" style="font-size: 14px;">The visual media included in the background of these final compositions consists of my personal photography and artwork, revolving around themes of urban landscapes, climate change, and futurism.</p>

                    <p class="p1" style="color: white; font-size: 14px;">Numbers, equations, regressions. To measure the world. To understand it. To build things upon it. The measurements work quite well. The understanding, however, depends on much more than the measurements, and is often flawed. This results in externalized costs and flawed power structures, which end up reinforcing themselves as we build ever more complex measurement systems.</p>
                    <p class="p1" style="color: white; font-size: 14px;">The world of climate data is uniquely complex. Exponential improvements in technology over the past decades have meant that measurements of the Earth’s climate systems are now constant, monitoring the atmosphere’s every move. The goal of much of this data collection is to then forecast the implications that the climate’s current warming trends have on future warming trends and to predict the likelihood of future extreme weather events. Ultimately, this data collection strives to understand the various possible futures we have ahead of us. This is done through climate modeling systems.</p>

                    <p class="p1" style="color: white; font-size: 14px;">The problem is that there are many different climate modeling systems, and each of these systems produce astronomical amounts of data that stretch across time and space. Experts, let alone the general public, are not able to personally examine every scrap of this information. That task is given to computers. But computers aren’t the ones who interpret data in order to make informed policy decisions or individual behavioral choices. Computers aren’t the ones who have to internalize the fact that actual lives are at stake here: lives of people today and lives of people generations down the line. Computers aren’t the ones who have to prioritize climate in their day-to-day lives. In order for data to be useful to society, it must be communicated by scientists to the general public. Because there is so much of it, picking out the notable trends becomes a necessity.</p>
                    <p class="p1" style="color: white; font-size: 14px;">Science is incredibly important. But as a collective, humans do not understand, internalize, or respond to science. We respond to stories. When we do end up responding to science, it is almost always because the story behind the data was told in a convincing way.</p>
                    <p class="p1" style="color: white; font-size: 14px;">This isn’t to say that any of this data should be fabricated or twisted. The numbers themselves should be verified and peer-reviewed to the upmost extent. But creating a care for numbers amongst the broader population has always been a challenge. In any scenario involving the communication of numbers to the broader public, there have been decisions made about which data to present and how to present it. If these decisions change the reality of the data, they are fraudulent. But in almost every case, there are several ways to accurately portray the same data, with vastly different takeaways for the audience in terms of comprehension, relevance, and urgency.</p>
                    <p class="p1" style="color: white; font-size: 14px;">The process of making decisions revolving around data communications is referred to as framing. Framing allows a scientist to pick out and highlight the most important trends in a dataset in order to aid broader comprehension. This is usually done visually, through graphs. Laying out specifically chosen numbers over space allows people to communicate important changes and trends in these numbers over time.</p>
                    <p class="p1" style="color: white; font-size: 14px;">This thesis will focus on an alternative type of dataset framing called sonification. Sonification is the conceptualization of data through sound. There are many different algorithms that can be used to sonify, each a different way of mapping notes into sound, typically with higher numbers corresponding to a higher pitch. Sonification first gained traction when entities such as NASA [1] began using it to help people understand the layout of galaxies. People have since used the technique to make better sense of income inequality on New York City subway lines [2] and to convey spatial data to people who are visually impaired [3] or less scientifically literate [4]. Various projects have also worked on sonifying climate data in particular, showing increasing temperatures and carbon dioxide levels over time through a more impactful medium.</p>
