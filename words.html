            <h1>Tic Tacs, Etc.</h1>
            <p class="p2"><br></p>
            <p class="p1">Tic Tac on his tongue replaces the sandy taste of bad news. That others had told, that he has told others. Scented sanitizer on his fingers sterilizes the corrosive grip of handshakes. People disappointing him, him disappointing people. Sound impressive, smile, peacock, sound impressive. Run it back, run it back, run it back.</p>
            <p class="p2"><br></p>
            <p class="p1">He grabs his baseball hat, glances down at his dress shirt and khakis. Casual Friday. The emblem on the hat reminds him of his college days, back when six shots of vodka was a good thing. The &ldquo;inspirational talk&rdquo; the Company had required employees to attend earlier that day was still swimming around in his head. Quite detrimental to the productivity.</p>
            <p class="p2"><br></p>
            <p class="p1"><em>&ldquo;Be grateful for what you have.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p class="p1">He knew he was privileged. He was indeed going to an all-inclusive beach resort next weekend, where he could blow all the money that he stacked up working the long hours, where sand and sea and sunburn could remind him how lucky he was. But his wife was in love with someone else. She hadn&rsquo;t actually done anything incriminating, but she was. And that type of dull ache wasn&rsquo;t the kind of thing that would go away with a miniature umbrella and a squeeze of lime. That type of ache was the type that would choke a person out, if focused on too intently. Best to let it fester, rationalize the best narrative of the situation, and think about work.</p>
            <p class="p1">And what <em>was</em> the best narrative of the situation, exactly? Feelings are hard to concretely describe, with no set patterns governing their existence, and therefore dumb. People shouldn&rsquo;t feel them. Women are wild creatures with no control over not feeling their feelings. They often give into them. Therefore, women are also dumb. Shame that he was attracted to them, and that humanity seemed to benefit from their existence. He didn&rsquo;t quite know how to grapple with those thoughts yet. Best to ignore them.</p>
            <p class="p2"><br></p>
            <p class="p1"><em>&ldquo;Stay mindful of what you are contributing to society. Help those less fortunate than yourself.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p class="p1">Yes, the world seemed to be going to hell in a handbasket, if you looked at it for too long. He had no doubt that people were suffering and animals were dying and future generations were getting screwed over. No doubt at all.</p>
            <p class="p1">But was any of this his problem? No. Because who could prove that he could change anything about it? Nobody. He probably couldn&rsquo;t. Might as well not waste effort trying. The system was unfair. Truth of life. Survival of the fittest (and the luckiest). So be it.</p>
            <p class="p1">Plus, his life was no piece of cake, either. And his priority should be to help himself out before helping others. Kind of like the oxygen mask instructions on a plane. Maybe one of these days he&rsquo;d find the energy to &ldquo;do something good.&rdquo; Though if he never got around to physically helping people, he had his food drive donations to point to, and his socially-liberal-fiscally-conservative vote.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p2"><br></p>
            <p class="p1"><em>&ldquo;Live to your absolute fullest potential.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p class="p1">Inspirational people were always getting off on shit like this. Wasn&rsquo;t everyone living to their fullest potential? It seemed strange that anyone would be purposely causing themselves suffering. Maybe this <em>was</em> everyone&rsquo;s best effort at contributing to the world. At &ldquo;being themselves.&rdquo; At &ldquo;showing affection.&rdquo; Maybe humans are just really shit at all of this stuff and have too much self awareness for our own good. Did you ever think of that, man?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="p1">Moreover, the argument that art and music were ways to access this fullest potential was absolute BS. These things were, in fact, just entrances to the rabbitholes of emotion. He couldn&rsquo;t have control over his emotions, couldn&rsquo;t win at them, there were no rules to them. Jumbles of abstract subtext that were too mysterious and disconcerting to be real, valuable components of life. Therefore, he wanted nothing to do with them. Gateways to the indescribable types of madness and confusion that he tried so desperately to avoid, that&rsquo;s what they were. The people who used them and felt them were heretics of hypnosis, addicts of adrenaline, absolute swines of society.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p2"><br></p>
            <p class="p1">He stops by the men&rsquo;s room to splash some water on his face and walks out through the manicured lobby to the Subway stop. Hitting legs at the gym really quick, tossling the hair of his boys, maybe helping with math homework, and then kicking back with some football. It was a decent life, in the everyday motions of it all. No need to complicate everything with overanalyses. You have your hand, and you play it. Simple as that.</p>
